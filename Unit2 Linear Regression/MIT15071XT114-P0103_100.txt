Hello, this is Dimitris.
This week, our lectures focus on applications of analytics
into interesting areas.
In the first lecture, we'll describe
how a Princeton professor used linear regression
to predict the quality of wine.
In the second lecture, we'll discuss the story
of Moneyball, and how data and analytics was
used to create a championship team.
Through these examples, we will teach you
the method of linear regression.
In both lectures, we'll use data to replicate the models in
R, and show how simple analytics can create a significant edge.
Let's get started.
