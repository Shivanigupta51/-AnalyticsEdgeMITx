PREDICTING STOCK RETURNS WITH CLUSTER-THEN-PREDICT

In the second lecture sequence this week, we heard about cluster-then-predict, a methodology in which you first cluster observations and then build cluster-specific prediction models. In the lecture sequence, we saw how this methodology helped improve the prediction of heart attack risk. In this assignment, we'll use cluster-then-predict to predict future stock prices using historical stock data.

When selecting which stocks to invest in, investors seek to obtain good future returns. In this problem, we will first use clustering to identify clusters of stocks that have similar returns over time. Then, we'll use logistic regression to predict whether or not the stocks will have positive future returns.

For this problem, we'll use StocksCluster.csv, which contains monthly stock returns from the NASDAQ stock exchange. The NASDAQ is the second-largest stock exchange in the world, and it lists many technology companies. The stock price data used in this problem was obtained from infochimps, a website providing access to many datasets.

Each observation in the dataset is the monthly returns of a particular company in a particular year. The years included are 2000-2009. The companies are limited to tickers that were listed on the exchange for the entire period 2000-2009, and whose stock price never fell below $1. So, for example, one observation is for Yahoo in 2000, and another observation is for Yahoo in 2001. Our goal will be to predict whether or not the stock return in December will be positive, using the stock returns for the first 11 months of the year.

This dataset contains the following variables:

ReturnJan = the return for the company's stock during January (in the year of the observation). 
ReturnFeb = the return for the company's stock during February (in the year of the observation). 
ReturnMar = the return for the company's stock during March (in the year of the observation). 
ReturnApr = the return for the company's stock during April (in the year of the observation). 
ReturnMay = the return for the company's stock during May (in the year of the observation). 
ReturnJune = the return for the company's stock during June (in the year of the observation). 
ReturnJuly = the return for the company's stock during July (in the year of the observation). 
ReturnAug = the return for the company's stock during August (in the year of the observation). 
ReturnSep = the return for the company's stock during September (in the year of the observation). 
ReturnOct = the return for the company's stock during October (in the year of the observation). 
ReturnNov = the return for the company's stock during November (in the year of the observation). 
PositiveDec = whether or not the company's stock had a positive return in December (in the year of the observation). This variable takes value 1 if the return was positive, and value 0 if the return was not positive.
For the first 11 variables, the value stored is a proportional change in stock value during that month. For instance, a value of 0.05 means the stock increased in value 5% during the month, while a value of -0.02 means the stock decreased in value 2% during the month.

PROBLEM 2.1 - INITIAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL  (2 points possible)
Run the following commands to split the data into a training set and testing set, putting 70% of the data in the training set and 30% of the data in the testing set:

set.seed(144)

spl = sample.split(stocks$PositiveDec, SplitRatio = 0.7)

stocksTrain = subset(stocks, spl == TRUE)

stocksTest = subset(stocks, spl == FALSE)

Then, use the stocksTrain data frame to train a logistic regression model (name it StocksModel) to predict PositiveDec using all the other variables as independent variables. Don't forget to add the argument family=binomial to your glm command.

PROBLEM 3.1 - CLUSTERING STOCKS  (1 point possible)
Now, let's cluster the stocks. The first step in this process is to remove the dependent variable using the following commands:

limitedTrain = stocksTrain

limitedTrain$PositiveDec = NULL

limitedTest = stocksTest

limitedTest$PositiveDec = NULL

Why do we need to remove the dependent variable in the clustering phase of the cluster-then-predict methodology?

 Leaving in the dependent variable might lead to unbalanced clusters Leaving in the dependent variable might lead to unbalanced clusters - incorrect  Removing the dependent variable decreases the computational effort needed to cluster  Needing to know the dependent variable value to assign an observation to a cluster defeats the purpose of the methodology

PROBLEM 3.2 - CLUSTERING STOCKS  (2/2 points)
In the market segmentation assignment in this week's homework, you were introduced to the preProcess command from the caret package, which normalizes variables by subtracting by the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

In cases where we have a training and testing set, we'll want to normalize by the mean and standard deviation of the variables in the training set. We can do this by passing just the training set to the preProcess function:

library(caret)

preproc = preProcess(limitedTrain)

normTrain = predict(preproc, limitedTrain)

normTest = predict(preproc, limitedTest)

What is the mean of the ReturnJan variable in normTrain?

 1.330682e-17 - correct  
What is the mean of the ReturnJan variable in normTest?

PROBLEM 4.4 - CLUSTER-SPECIFIC PREDICTIONS  (1/1 point)
To compute the overall test-set accuracy of the cluster-then-predict approach, we can combine all the test-set predictions into a single vector and all the true outcomes into a single vector:

AllPredictions = c(PredictTest1, PredictTest2, PredictTest3)

AllOutcomes = c(stocksTest1$PositiveDec, stocksTest2$PositiveDec, stocksTest3$PositiveDec)

What is the overall test-set accuracy of the cluster-then-predict approach, again using a threshold of 0.5?

 0.5788716 - correct  
We see a modest improvement over the original logistic regression model. Since predicting stock returns is a notoriously hard problem, this is a good increase in accuracy. By investing in stocks for which we are more confident that they will have positive returns (by selecting the ones with higher predicted probabilities), this cluster-then-predict model can give us an edge over the original logistic regression model.
