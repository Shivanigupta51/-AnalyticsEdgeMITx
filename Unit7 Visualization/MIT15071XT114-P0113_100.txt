This week, we'll be discussing the power of visualizations
for understanding worldwide trends
and for using analytics to stop crime.
In the first lecture, we'll use data from the World Health
Organization to create visualizations
that help us understand and communicate
global health trends.
In the second lecture, we'll discuss predictive policing,
and how police departments across the country
are using data and analytics to improve decision making.
Through these examples, we'll create visualizations in R
that help us understand our data and our models.
Let's get started.
