This week we'll see how we can use analytics
to understand opinions and intelligence.
In the first lecture, we'll see how

In the second lecture, we'll discuss
how IBM built a computer that could beat the best

Through these examples, we'll introduce the exciting area

into variables to be used in our models.
Let's get started.
