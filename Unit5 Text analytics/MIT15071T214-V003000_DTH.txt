The game of Jeopardy has three rounds.
Jeopardy, Double Jeopardy, where the dollar values are doubled,
and Final Jeopardy, when contestants
can wager an amount of money on one single question.
Each round has five questions in six categories.
It consists of a wide variety of topics,
over 2,500 different categories.
Each question has dollar value.
The first to buzz in and answer correctly wins the money.
If they answer incorrectly, they lose the money.
An example of a round involves the following categories:
Dinosaurs, Notable Women, Oxford English Dictionary,
Name That Instrument, Belgium, and Composers by Country.
The type of questions Jeopardy includes,
includes cryptic definitions of categories and clues.
And the answer is in the form of a question.
Let me give you two examples.
Question is: Mozart's last and perhaps most powerful symphony
shares its name with this planet.
The answer should be, "What is Jupiter?"
Another example: smaller than only Greenland,
it's the world's second largest island.
And the answer, "What is New Guinea?"
