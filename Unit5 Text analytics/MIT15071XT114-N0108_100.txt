In this lecture, we have seen a particular application
of sentiment analysis on Twitter.
However, the area of sentiment analysis is much broader.
Over 7,000 research articles have been written on the topic.
Hundreds of start-ups are developing sentiment analysis
solutions.
Many websites perform real-time analysis of tweets.
For example, "tweetfeel" shows trends
given any term, and "The Stock Sonar"
shows sentiment and stock prices.
Let's talk about text analytics a bit more generally.
Sentiment analysis is a particular application
of text analytics.
In general, the critical aspect of text analytics
is to select the specific features that
are relevant in a particular application.
In addition, it's important to apply specific knowledge that
often leads to better results.
For example, using the meaning of the symbols or include
features like the number of words.

Let's finally discuss the analytics edge
that we have seen in this lecture.
Analytical sentiment analysis we have seen
can replace more labor-intensive methods like polling.
Text analytics can also deal with the massive amounts
of unstructured data being generated on the internet.
Computers are becoming more and more
capable of interacting with humans
and performing human tasks.
In the next lecture, we'll discuss IBM Watson,
an impressive feat in the area of text analytics.
