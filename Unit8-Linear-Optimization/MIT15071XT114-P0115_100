Hello.
This week we'll discuss a new area
of analytics, optimization.
In the first lecture, we'll see how American Airlines used
revenue management to offer discounted fares
and beat the competition.
Through this example, we teach you
how to solve optimization problems with a spreadsheet
software.
In the second lecture, we'll discuss
how optimization is used to design radiation therapy
treatments.
Let's get started.
