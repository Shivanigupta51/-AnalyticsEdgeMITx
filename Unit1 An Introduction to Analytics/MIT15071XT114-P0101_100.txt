Welcome to 15.071x, the Analytics Edge.
I'm Allison O'Hair, and together with Dimitris Bertsimas,
we'll be the instructors for this course.
During this week, we'll start with an introduction
to analytics and to the topics we'll
cover throughout the course.
Then in the second lecture, we'll
introduce R, a statistical modeling language that we'll
use throughout most of the course.
The recitation and homework assignment this week
were designed to give you more practice working in R.
And by the end of the week, we hope that you'll already
be convinced about the power of data.
Let's get started.
